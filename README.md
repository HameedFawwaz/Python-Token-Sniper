# Python-Token-Sniper

This project initially started as an idea of a profitable crypto trading bot that would do so by immediately token-swapping new liquidity pairs on UniSwap and PancakeSwap. This project works on testnets but was never deployed on the actual blockchain (I WOULD HIGHLY ADVISE AGAINST DEPLOYING THIS TRADING BOT ON THE BLOCKCHAIN AS THERE IS SERIOUS POTENTIAL FOR FINANCIAL LOSS). This project now serves as a portfolio project to demonstrate my understanding. 

Things I Learned from this Project:
 - How to deploy a Python application on the blockchain using web3
 - How to modify Solidity files to interact with the blockchain
 - Using asynchronous processes

***NOTE***: As I said earlier, I would highly advise **AGAINST** running this project and for such reasons, I have not included instructions on how to run the project. **I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY FINANCIAL LOSS AS A RESULT OF YOU RUNNING THIS PROJECT.**
